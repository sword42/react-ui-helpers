Coming to React from Angular, it hurt not to have the form component framework from Angular. ngModel, along with the validation support, allow complex forms with nested components without requiring a rigid structure.

Following the React "Data Down/Events Up" model can get nasty with many nested input components. These helpers are meant to ease the pain.
